# filereader
A command line program that allows you to read a file and search for key words
To use this program simply open it up, copy the path to a text file into the part of the code that says 'file name' and run it.
it will then ask you to enter the word you are searching for and will search for the word in the text, once it finds the word it will stop the program.
I plan to add a feature were it reads the whole document and then searches for all the mentions of the word and prints them all out.
