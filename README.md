# filereader
A command line program that allows you to read a file and search for key words
To use this program simply open it up, copy the path to a text file into the part of the code that says 'file name' and run it.
It will then ask you to enter the word you are searching for and will search for it in the file, if the word you were seaching for is found it will print the line and line number.
If no word is found it will let you know.
