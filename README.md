A command line program that allows you to read a file and search for key words.
To use this program simply open it up, copy in the text you want to search or keep the prewritten text (credit:https://randomwordgenerator.com/sentence.php)
It will then ask you if you want to keep the formating or change it. Then you can enter the word you are searching for and will search for it in the file, if the word you were seaching for is found it will print the line and line number.
If no word is found it will let you know.
